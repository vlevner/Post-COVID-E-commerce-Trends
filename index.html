            <h2>From Crisis to Transformation: How COVID-19 Reshaped Canadian E-commerce</h2>
            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            <p>
                The COVID-19 pandemic significantly changed how Canadians shop, sell, and do business. E-commerce became essential for both consumers and businesses during lockdowns. Understanding this shift is important for three key reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Economic Impact</li>
                <li>Digital Equity and Access</li>
                <li>Policy and Future Planning</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                E-commerce is now a lasting part of Canada’s economy. By exploring how adoption changed across different regions, industries, and age groups, this project supports smarter investments in technology, innovation, and economic inclusion.
            </p>
            <h4>Key Question:</h4>
            <p>How has e-commerce in Canada evolved across time, demographics, sectors, and regions since 2019, and what lasting changes emerged after the COVID-19 lockdowns?</p>

            <h4>Most Common Technologies and Platforms Used by Canadians</h4>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of various digital platforms among Canadians. There was a substantial increase in the use of video communication technologies in 2020 compared with 2018. Cluster analysis indicated that this trend was most evident in the use of online voice or video calls, with the proportion of Canadians in each internet user group participating in this activity rising by more than 10 percentage points. In 2020, one-quarter of basic users reported making online voice or video calls. </p>
            <p>The pandemic also contributed to higher engagement with online entertainment platforms. Between 2018 and 2020, the share of Canadians subscribing to streaming services rose by 7 percentage pointd among basic users, by 15 percentage points among intermediate users, by 10 percentage points among proficient users, and by 5 percentage points among advanced users.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, COVID-19 prompted a notable shift toward online retail platforms as restrictions limited in-person shopping. Across all cohorts of internet users, online shopping activity increased significantly from 2018 to 2020. In 2020, virtually all advanced users (97%) purchased goods online, as did over 90% of proficient users. While online shopping was already prevalent among these groups in 2018, substantial increases were still observed over the period (Wavrock et al., 2022).</p>
            
            <h4>Challenges Businesses Faced During the Pandemic</h4>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on Canadian businesses, though some sectors were disproportionately affected. According to the Bank of Canada and the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions, over 60% of firms reported lower revenues in 2020 compared to 2019. Accommodation and food services were among the hardest hit, with 43.9% of businesses in these sectors experiencing revenue declines of 40% or more, according to Statistics Canada. Many of these firms relied on government support programs such as the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) to remain operational. In contrast, sectors such as agriculture, fishing, and hunting were less affected, with only 6.1% of firms reporting revenue declines of 40% or more, (Grieder et al., 2021)</p>
            
            <h4>Changes in Consumer Preferences</h4>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on global consumer behavior, influencing not only what people buy but also how they choose to pay. 44% of Canadians reported shifting their payment preferences toward contactless and digital methods, with greater reliance on credit cards over cash for everyday purchases (Payments Canada, 2020.). The pandemic also accelerated the shift to online shopping, reducing the frequency of in-person transactions. Between February 2020 and July 2022, retail e-commerce sales grew by 67.9%, with e-commerce’s share of total retail sales rising significantly from 2019 to 2022, (Zanzana & Martin, 2023).</p>
            
            <h4>Shaping Online Retail</h4>
            <p>For non-essential retail subsectors—such as clothing and accessories, furniture and home furnishings, electronics and appliances, and sporting goods, hobby, book, and music stores—e-commerce sales rose while in-store sales declined, largely due to mandated store closures at the onset of the pandemic, (Zanzana & Martin, 2023).</p>
            <p>During the pandemic, widespread supply chain disruptions impacted businesses across multiple sectors of the Canadian economy. Drawing on Statistics Canada data, the manufacturing sector proved particularly vulnerable to global supply chain shocks due to its reliance on foreign suppliers for inputs and foreign markets for sales. In contrast, retail and other service industries were generally less affected, as they depend more heavily on domestic suppliers and markets, (Government of Canada, 2020).</p>

    <!-- Guiding Theories -->

            <summary>Guiding Theories</summary>
            <h3>Framing Hypotheses and Guiding Theories</h3>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a major shift in Canadian consumer behavior, particularly in the rapid and widespread adoption of e-commerce platforms. Several theoretical frameworks help explain this transformation, including Diffusion of Innovations Theory, behavioral economics, and public policy theories.</p>
            
            <h4>Diffusion of Innovations Theory</h4>
            <p>According to Everett Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations Theory, the adoption of new technologies depends on factors such as the perceived advantage of the innovation, the communication channels used to spread information about it, the time required for adoption, and the characteristics of the surrounding social system. During the pandemic, e-commerce offered clear relative advantages—such as health safety and convenience—making it more appealing than traditional shopping. Digital communication platforms enabled fast information sharing, while social influence accelerated trust and uptake. These conditions allowed Canadians to quickly move through adopter categories—from innovators to laggards—reaching a critical mass that normalized e-commerce as a mainstream retail method, (Canada Commons, n.d.)</p>
            
            <h4>Behavioral Economics and Consumer Decision-Making</h4>
            <p>Behavioral economics further explains how consumers responded to pandemic uncertainty. The crisis triggered a widespread need for psychological reassurance, prompting consumers to rely on digital platforms that offered convenience, safety, and emotional comfort (Livingstone, 2020). The urgency of health concerns and economic pressures reshaped shopping priorities, leading to increased purchases of essential goods, wellness products, and trusted brand items. This shift highlights the importance of consumer trust and regulatory transparency as online commerce continues to evolve.</p>
            
            <h4>Public Policy Responses and Theoretical Frameworks</h4>
            <p>Public policy theories such as the Advocacy Coalition Framework and Kingdon’s Policy Windows offer insight into how governments responded to e-commerce growth. During the pandemic, windows of opportunity opened for rapid digital transformation, prompting policy responses that supported online infrastructure and consumer protections. These responses reflect how crises can trigger temporary alignment among stakeholders, enabling swift policy innovation and support for digital commerce.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><b>Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF):</b> External events—such as crises—can serve as catalysts for major policy shifts, allowing advocacy coalitions to exploit windows of opportunity for policy change, (Jenkins-Smith & Weible, 2025).</li>
                <li><b>Kingdon’s Multiple Streams Framework (MSF):</b> During the COVID-19 pandemic, the alignment of pressing problems (public health crisis), viable policy solutions (digital infrastructure expansion), and political will (urgent public and governmental support) created a window that enabled swift policy innovations like enhanced online infrastructure and protections. Kingdon notes that such windows are rare and remain open only briefly—but crises can create the conditions for them, (Giese, 2020).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Hypotheses on E-commerce Persistence</h4>
            <p>Empirical data suggests that many e-commerce habits formed during the pandemic may endure in the long term. Between February 2020 and July 2022, Canadian e-commerce retail sales surged by 67.9%, with e-commerce's share of total retail sales rising from 3.9% in 2019 to 6.2% in 2022 (Zanzana & Martin, 2023). Though initial peaks have declined slightly, levels remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic benchmarks. Additionally, demographic factors play a major role: younger, wealthier, and more digitally literate consumers have shown greater e-commerce adoption, while older or lower-income individuals face more barriers to access.</p>
            <p>A national survey on grocery shopping behavior found that even by early 2022, 65% of consumers had not returned to pre-pandemic habits. Only 9 respondents indicated they would “definitely” revert to old routines, suggesting lasting behavioral changes (Galushko & Riabchyk, 2024). Based on these findings, it is reasonable to hypothesize that e-commerce will remain a prominent component of Canadian retail, particularly among digitally connected demographics. </p>

                    <h3>Insight 1: Rapid Adoption During the Pandemic</h3>
                    <p>In 2019, e-commerce accounted for 3.9% of total retail sales. By mid-2020, this surged to 6%, representing a 77% year-over-year increase in market share. Lockdowns, safety concerns, and supply chain shifts accelerated adoption far faster than anticipated. Federal supports (CERB, CEWS), record-low interest rates, and programs like Go Digital Canada enabled households and businesses to pivot quickly. Between February and May 2020, e-commerce sales nearly doubled to $3.9B, offsetting steep declines in physical store sales and permanently expanding Canada’s online retail base.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Insight 2: Gaps in Digital Adoption Across Age, Industry, and Region</h3>
                    <p>E-commerce adoption has been uneven. Canadians aged 25–44 are the most active online shoppers, with participation rates exceeding 80% in certain categories, while the 65+ demographic remains significantly underrepresented, particularly for digital goods. Industry adoption varies widely—Information & Cultural Industries and Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation lead with 13–14% average online sales share, whereas sectors with heavier reliance on in-person transactions lag behind. Regionally, urban businesses consistently outperform rural ones, reflecting differences in broadband access, logistics, and market readiness. Bridging these divides will require targeted digital inclusion strategies to ensure equitable participation across demographics, sectors, and communities.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Insight 3: Lasting Impact Beyond the Pandemic</h3>
                    <p> Although e-commerce volumes have eased from their pandemic highs, the sector’s share of retail remains well above pre-2020 benchmarks—6.2% in 2022 versus 3.9% in 2019. This new baseline reflects a structural change in consumer habits, with online channels now embedded into mainstream retail strategies. Leading provinces such as Ontario (8.50%), BC (7.75%), and Quebec (6.33%) continue to sustain high adoption rates, indicating that pandemic-driven shifts have fundamentally reshaped Canada’s retail landscape. Continued investment in digital infrastructure and policy support will be essential to maintain momentum and close participation gaps.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic triggered an unprecedented surge in Canadian e-commerce adoption, as lockdowns, public health concerns, and targeted government programs accelerated digital transitions for both consumers and businesses. Adoption, however, has not been uniform—significant gaps remain across age groups, industries, and regions, particularly between urban and rural communities and between younger and older Canadians. While peak sales volumes have moderated since 2020–2021, e-commerce now holds a stable share well above pre-pandemic levels, signaling a lasting structural change in Canada’s retail economy. Addressing adoption gaps through digital infrastructure investment, skills training, and inclusive policy design will be key to ensuring that the benefits of this transformation are shared equitably.</p>

                <h3>1. Research Design</h3>
                <p><strong>Approach:</strong> This study adopts a quantitative research approach, drawing on both secondary statistical datasets and insights from prior scholarly and industry research. The dashboards created from datasets spanning 2018–2024 provide empirical evidence of changes in online sales patterns, while literature sources offer theoretical and contextual grounding for interpreting those shifts.</p> 
                <br>
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Quantitative analysis enables the precise measurement of trends such as year-over-year growth in online sales, demographic participation rates, and industry-specific performance. Literature research highlights global shifts in consumer behavior, the acceleration of digital adoption during the pandemic, and persistent post-COVID e-commerce expansion. Combining these insights with the data-driven dashboards allows for a more robust understanding of both measurable outcomes and underlying behavioral factors. </p>
                <br>    
                <p><strong>Scope:</strong> The analysis covers the years 2017–2026, segmented into three key phases:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pre-COVID (2017–2019):</strong> Baseline online sales and consumer behavior patterns. </li>
                        <li><strong>During COVID (2020–2021):</strong> Sudden surges in digital adoption due to lockdowns and mobility restrictions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Post-COVID (2022–2026):</strong> Stabilization and long-term trends, including possible market saturation or continued growth.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Descriptive statistics:</strong> Calculated average e-commerce sales percentages by year, business type (urban vs rural), province, and industry. Identified top-performing provinces (e.g., Ontario at 8.50%) and industries (e.g., Information & Cultural Industries at ~14%).</li>
                    <li><strong>Trend analysis:</strong> Tracked year-over-year changes in e-commerce share (e.g., largest increase in 2020 at 77.02%). Compared sales performance across 2021–2024 to identify post-COVID recovery patterns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Demographic segmentation:</strong> Analyzed online purchasing behavior by age groups (15–24, 25–44, 45–64, 65+), differentiating between product categories such as digital goods, physical goods, and services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visualization tools:</strong> Developed interactive dashboards in Tableau featuring line charts (sales trends), bar charts (industry and demographic comparisons), area charts (urban vs rural differences), and geographic heatmaps (provincial breakdowns).</li>
                    <li><strong>Comparative analysis:</strong> Linked datasets on region, business characteristics, and time periods to assess relationships between geographic location, business type, and sales performance without merging inconsistent datasets.</li>

                <h3>6. Limitations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data availability:</strong> While monthly e-commerce sales data is seasonally adjusted, certain months or years may be missing due to delays or gaps in reporting. Some datasets, such as demographic breakdowns, are only available for select years, limiting longitudinal analysis. Additionally, data for retail trade sales shows only sales in core retail, suggesting smaller numbers compared to overall retail.</li>
                    <li><strong>External confounders:</strong> Observed trends may be influenced by factors outside the scope of the data, including inflationary pressures, global supply-chain disruptions, changes in consumer confidence, and policy interventions unrelated to COVID-19 and the economy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assumptions:</strong> The analysis assumes that seasonal adjustment effectively removes predictable annual fluctuations, allowing for clearer trend comparisons across pre-COVID, during-COVID, and post-COVID periods. It also assumes that reported data from different Statistics Canada tables are methodologically consistent and directly comparable.</li>
